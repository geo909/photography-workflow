# Todo

## Importing

### Mount

Todo: external command

### Import

Input: source directory (mounted in previous step)

1. Rename to yyyy-MM-dd_HHmmSS.ext
2. Put in a YYYY-MM folder
3. Ignore if target filename in ignore.txt

#### Maintenance

1. Command that extracts jpg -if it doesn't exist- for each cr2/raf file with 1 star
2. Delete all cr2/raf files and their associated jpgs, for each one that
   - has -1 star rating, or
   - is in ignore.txt (redundant probably, but why not)

#### Backup

To think later

#### Ansel

Think later about streamlinining running it and updating it.
